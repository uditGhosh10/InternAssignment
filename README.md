1. The Coding.java file contains code for the first 2 coding questions. **The code passes all the provided test cases in the questions**. Additionally, a few assumptions have been made which have been mentioned in the comments to handle particular scenarios ( like, say if input is given as 0.10, I'll output 0 since the number given is a valid number, that could be converted into an integer. I assumed this since no input test cases have been specificically provided to handle such cases.)
2. Databases.sql contains solution to question number 3
